      <p>So I was born and raised in Riverside, California. I don't really know where to begin since I never reallly thought about what I did so here it goes. I pretty much played alot of video games growing up as a kid. I also liked to Skateboard although I wasn't vert good at it, I enjoyed crusing around as to why I'm considering getting a longboard now. I played video games for hours until high school as I started as I played sports and social life started to grow.</p>

      <P>I have always been into technology as far as video games go which is probabaly the reason what got me into coding in the first place. I know this is web-development which I do find very interesting, but I would also like to learn more languages like Java, C++, Python etc. I know if I put the time into this, it will pay off in the end.
        
      </P>
